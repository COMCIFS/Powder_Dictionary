    This section contains information about peaks in an amorphous phase
    extracted from the measured or, if present, the processed diffractogram.
    Each peak in this table will have a unique label
    (see _pd_amorphous.peak_id).

    See PD_PEAK for details on the specific peak parameters that may be
    recorded. Each amorphous peak may or may not be associated with an indexed
    reflection, and as such, an "amorphous" phase could represent a material
    with an unknown crystal structure. Amorphous peaks do not correspond to
    background, and should not be used as such.

    Note that peak positions are customarily determined from the processed
    diffractogram, and thus corrections for position and intensity will have
    been previously applied.

    This category defines various background functions that could be used when
    calculating diffractograms.

    The data items list here allow for the recording of the various coefficients
    used, rather than a complete enumeration of the value of the background
    calculated at every data point; although doing so is still possible - see
    _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_calc.

    The computed background values should include all normalization corrections,
    and thus are specified on the same scale as the observed intensities
    (_pd_meas.counts_* or _pd_meas.intensity_*, and _pd_calc.intensity_total).

    If more than one type of background is specified for a particular
    diffractogram, then it is assumed they are linearly additive.

    **DEPRECATED**
    Use _pd_phase.id, _pd_diffractogram.id, or _audit.block_code' as
    necessary.

    _pd_block.id is used to assign a unique ID code to a data block.
    This code is then used for references between different blocks
    (see _pd_block_diffractogram.id, _pd_phase_block.id and
    _pd_qpa_external_std.diffractogram_block_id).

    Note that a data block may contain only a single diffraction
    data set or information about a single crystalline phase.
    However, a single diffraction measurement may yield structural
    information on more than one phase, or a single structure
    determination may use more than one data set. Alternatively,
    results from a single data set, such as calibration parameters
    from measurements of a standard, may be used for many subsequent
    analyses. Through use of the ID code, a reference made between
    data sets may be preserved when the file is exported from the
    laboratory from which the CIF originated.

    The ID code assigned to each data block should be unique with
    respect to an ID code assigned for any other data block in the
    world. The naming scheme chosen for the block-ID format is
    designed to ensure uniqueness.

    It is the responsibility of a data archive site or local
    laboratory to create a catalogue of block IDs if that site
    wishes to resolve these references.

    **DEPRECATED**
    Use _pd_phase.id, _pd_diffractogram.id, or _audit.block_code,
    as necessary.

    Used to assign a unique character string to a block.
    Note that this code is not intended to be parsed; the
    concatenation of several strings is used in order to
    generate a string that can reasonably be expected to
    be unique.

    This code is assigned by the originator of the data set and
    is used for references between different CIF blocks.
    The ID will normally be created when the block is first
    created. It is possible to loop more than one ID for a
    block: if changes or additions are made to the
    block later, a new ID may be assigned, but the original name
    should be retained.

    The suggested format for the ID code is:
      <date-time>|<block_name>|<creator_name>|<instr_name>

     <date-time>    is the date and time the CIF was created
                    or modified.

     <block_name>   is an arbitrary name assigned by the
                    originator of the data set. It will
                    usually match the name of the phase
                    and possibly the name of the current CIF
                    data block (i.e. the string xxxx in a
                    data_xxxx identifier). It may be a sample name.

     <creator_name> is the name of the person who measured the
                    diffractogram, or prepared or modified the CIF.

     <instr_name>  is a unique name (as far as possible) for
                    the data-collection instrument, preferably
                    containing the instrument serial number for
                    commercial instruments. It is also possible to
                    use the Internet name or address for the
                    instrument computer as a unique name.

    As blocks are created in a CIF, the original sample identifier
    (i.e. <block_name>) should be retained, but the <creator_name>
    may be changed and the <date-time> will always change.
    The <date-time> will usually match either the
    _pd_meas.datetime_initiated or the _pd_proc.info_datetime
    entry.

    Within each section of the code, the following characters
    may be used:
                  A-Z a-z 0-9 # & * . : , - _ + / ( ) \ [ ]

    The sections are separated with vertical rules '|' which are
    not allowed within the sections. Blank spaces may also
    not be used. Capitalization may be used within the ID code
    but should not be considered significant - searches for
    data-set ID names should be case-insensitive.

    Date-time entries follow the standard RFC 3339 ABNF format
    'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss{Z|[+-]zz:zz}'.

    An archive site that wishes to make CIFs available via
    the web may substitute the URL for the file containing the
    appropriate block for the final two sections of the ID
    (<creator_name> and <instr_name>). Note that this should
    not be done unless the archive site is prepared to keep the
    file available online indefinitely.

    This section defines the parameters used for the calibration
    of time-of-flight from d-spacing for neutron data.

    The calibration equation is of the form:

    TOF = Sum( c~i~ * d^p~i~, i=0:N)

    where TOF is the time-of-flight in microseconds, d is the
    d-spacing in angstroms, c~i~ is the ith coefficient, and
    p~i~ is the ith power.

    A loop is used to specify all terms of the correction
    per histogram.

    This section defines the parameters used for the intensity calibration of
    the detectors which are used directly or indirectly in the
    interpretation of this data set. The information in this section of the CIF
    should generally be written when the intensities are first measured, but
    from then on should remain unchanged. Loops may be used for calibration
    information that differs by detector channel or ID.

    Common intensity calibration procedures include, but are not limited to:
     i)  the application of a known, uniform, flood-field; or
     ii) scanning a detector bank across a peak, or the direct-beam.

    The above examples provide experimental methods to assign values to
    _pd_calib_detected_intensity.detector_response which place each detector on
    a common scale. Note that these are only indicative examples.

    This category is only intended to record detector-related response to
    a beam incident on the detector. To record variations in intensity during
    the measurement of a diffractogram, see _pd_meas.intensity_monitor and
    _pd_meas.counts_monitor.

    A value that indicates the relative sensitivity of each detector. That is, a
    value of 0.5 indicates that the detector records half as much intensity as
    it should, and a value of 2 indicates that the detector records twice as
    much intensity as it should. To bring all detectors on to a common scale,
    the observed intensity should be divided by the value of
    _pd_calib_detected_intensity.detector_response

    This can compensate for differences in electronics, size and collimation.
    Usually, one detector, or the mean for all detectors, will be assigned the
    value of 1.

    interpretation of this data set. The information in this section of the CIF
    should generally be written when the intensities are first measured, but
    from then on should remain unchanged.

    One common intensity calibration procedures involves data collection from a
    standard amount of crystalline sample, which allows a value to be assigned
    to _pd_calib_incident_intensity.incident_intensity, to place different
    diffractograms on a common scale. Note that this is only an indicative
    example.

    This category is deprecated. Please see PD_CALIB_XCOORD and
    PD_CALIB_XCOORD_OVERALL.

    Data items in this category define an offset angle (in degrees)
    used to calibrate 2θ (as defined in _pd_meas.2theta_*).
    Calibration is done by adding the offset:

         2θ~calibrated~ = 2θ~measured~ + 2θ~offset~

    For cases where the _pd_calib.2theta_offset value is
    not a constant, but rather varies with 2θ, a set
    of offset values is supplied in a loop. In this case,
    the value where the offset has been determined can be
    specified as _pd_calib.2theta_off_point. Alternatively, a
    range where the offset is applicable can be specified using
    _pd_calib.2theta_off_min and _pd_calib.2theta_off_max.

    This category allows for linking to the diffractograms and phases used in
    the calibration of the wavelength used directly or indirectly in the
    interpretation of this data set.

    Loops may be used when multiple phases and/or diffractograms are used for
    calibration. In this case, the given wavelength is a best-fit to all phases
    and diffractograms.

    This section defines the parameters used for the calibration of the
    X-coordinate axis of the instrument used directly or indirectly in the
    interpretation of this data set; that is, 2\q, time-of-flight, or
    position.

    Calibration is carried out be adding the offset value:

        X-coord~calibrated~ = X-coord~meas~ + X-coord~offset~

    For cases where the offset value is not a constant, but rather varies
    with X-coordinate, a set of offset values is supplied in a loop. In this
    case, the value where the offset has been determined can be specified as
    _pd_calib_xcoord.*_nominal. These values may need to be interpolated to
    be applied to their respective diffractograms.

    Alternatively, if the offset has been determined at each measurement
    point in the diffractogram, _pd_calib_xcoord.point_id may be used to
    specify the offset on a per-point basis.

    'Specimen', 'sample', and 'material' have specific meanings, and sometimes
    cannot be specifically deliniated. The 'specimen' is the artefact placed
    into the beam from which the diffraction measurement is taken, and is
    described in PD_SPEC. The specimen is made from the 'sample', which can have
    information specified in PD_PREP. The sample is drawn from a 'material',
    which may exist in an actual or idealised sense, which can have information
    specified in PD_CHAR. For example: the material might be BaTiO3, the
    sample might be a specific batch from a specific manufacturer, and the
    specimen is the material taken from the bottle and placed in the instrument.

    The colour of the material used for the measurement.
    To facilitate more standardized use of names, the
    following guidelines for colour naming developed by
    Peter Bayliss for the International Centre for
    Diffraction Data (ICDD) should be followed. Note that
    combinations of descriptors are separated by an
    underscore.

    Allowed colours are:
      colourless, white, black, gray, brown, red, pink,
      orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.

    Colours may be modified using prefixes of:
      light, dark, whitish, blackish, grayish, brownish,
      reddish, pinkish, orangish, yellowish, greenish, bluish.

    Intermediate hues may be indicated with two colours:
    e.g. blue_green or bluish_green.

    For metallic materials, the term metallic may be added:
    e.g. reddish_orange_metallic for copper.

    The ICDD standard allows commas to be used for minerals
    that occur with ranges of colours; however this usage is
    not appropriate for the description of a single sample.

    This section contains the measured diffractogram prior to
    processing and application of correction terms. While additional
    information may be added to the CIF as data are processed and
    transported between laboratories, the information in this section of
    the CIF will rarely be changed once data collection is complete.

    Where possible, measurements in this section should have no
    post-collection processing applied (normalizations, corrections,
    smoothing, zero-offset corrections etc.). Such corrected
    measurements should be recorded in the PD_PROC section.

    Data sets that are measured as counts, where a standard
    uncertainty can be considered equivalent to the standard
    deviation and where the standard deviation can be estimated
    as the square root of the number of counts recorded, should
    use the _pd_meas.counts_* fields. All other intensity values
    should be recorded using _pd_meas.intensity_*.

    Bragg-Brentano diffractometer. This distance is also referred to as

    trace from film or a strip chart recorder. This is an
    alternative to _pd_meas.2theta_scan, which should only be

    against 2θ. For instruments where the position scale
    is nonlinear, the data item _pd_meas.detector_id should

    function to convert this distance to a 2θ angle
    or d-space, should be supplied with items from PD_CALIB.

    If the background is estimated for a limited number of points
    and the calculated background is then extrapolated from
    these fixed points, indicate the background values for
    these points with _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_fix. Use a value
    of '.' for data points where a fixed background has not
    been defined. The extrapolated background at every point
    may be specified using _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_calc.

    Background values should be on the same scale as the
    _pd_proc.intensity_net values. Thus normalization and
    correction factors should be applied before
    background subtraction (or should be applied to the
    background values equally).

    The other normalization factors applied to the data set (for
    example, Lp corrections, compensation for variation in
    counting time) may be specified in _pd_proc.intensity_norm.
    The function should be specified as the one used to divide the
    measured intensities.

    This section contains information relevant to the instrument
    used for the diffraction measurement. For most laboratories,
    very little of this information will change, so a standard file
    may be prepared and included with each data set.

    Note that several definitions in the core CIF dictionary
    are relevant here. For example, use:
      _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.value for the source wavelength,
      _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.type for the X-ray wavelength type,
      _diffrn_source.device and _diffrn_source.details for the radiation source,
      _diffrn_radiation.polarisn_ratio for the source polarization,
      _diffrn_radiation.probe for the radiation type.
    For data sets measured with partially monochromatized radiation,
    for example, where both Kα~1~ and Kα~2~ are present, it is
    important that all wavelengths present are included in a
    loop_ using _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.value to define the
    wavelength and _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.wt to define the
    relative intensity of that wavelength. It is required that
    _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.id also be present in the
    wavelength loop. It may also be useful to
    create a "dummy" ID to use for labelling
    peaks/reflections where the Kα~1~ and Kα~2~ wavelengths are
    not resolved. Set _diffrn_radiation_wavelength.wt to be 0 for
    such a dummy ID.

    In the PD_INSTR definitions, the term monochromator refers
    to a primary beam (pre-specimen) monochromator and the term
    analyser refers to post-diffraction (post-specimen)
    monochromator. The analyser may be fixed for specific
    wavelength or may be capable of being scanned.

    It is strongly recommended that the core dictionary term
    _diffrn_radiation.probe (specifying the nature of the radiation
    used) is employed for all data sets.

    _description.text
;
    The radius of the detector circle (also called the 'goniometer circle'
    or 'diffractometer circle').

    The detector circle is defined either by the centre of the active window
    of a stationary detector, or, in most cases, by a detector moving around
    the specimen. The radius is the distance from the specimen to the
    detector.

    In this construction, the detector radius is constant for all measurement
    points. For geometries where this is not the case, see
    _pd_instr.dist_vsrc_spec and _pd_instr.dist_spec_vdetc.

    Where the specimen-detector distance is difficult to define, for example,
    for a large, flat, area detector, the distance refers to the closest
    approach of the detector to the specimen.

    See the discussion on 'detector circle' or 'goniometer circle' in
    International Tables Vol H, S2.1.4.1 for further information.

    _pd_instr.monochr_post_spec to specify the
    post-diffraction analyser (post-specimen monochromation).

    When a monochromator crystal is used, the material and the
    indices of the Bragg reflection are specified.

    Note that monochromators may have either 'parallel' or
    'antiparallel' orientation. It is assumed that the
    geometry is parallel unless specified otherwise.
    In a parallel geometry, the position of the monochromator
    allows the incident beam and the final post-specimen
    and post-monochromator beam to be as close to parallel
    as possible. In a parallel geometry, the diffracting
    planes in the specimen and monochromator will be parallel
    when 2θ~monochromator~ is equal to 2θ~specimen~.
    For further discussion see R. Jenkins & R. Snyder (1996).

    This section contains information relevant to the detector
    geometry used for the diffraction measurement. For most laboratories,
    very little of this information will change, so a standard file
    may be prepared and included with each data set.

    The term analyser refers to post-diffraction (post-specimen)
    monochromator. The analyser may be fixed for specific
    wavelength or may be capable of being scanned.

    For multiple-detector instruments it may be necessary to loop the
    *_anal_detc or *_spec_detc values (for  _pd_instr.dist_*,
    _pd_instr.divg_*, _pd_instr.slit_* and  _pd_instr.soller_*) with

    Indicates the method used to obtain monochromatic radiation.
    Use _pd_instr.monochr_pre_spec to describe the primary beam
    monochromator (pre-specimen monochromation). Use
    _pd_instr.monochr_post_spec to specify the
    post-diffraction analyser (post-specimen monochromation).

    When a monochromator crystal is used, the material and the
    indices of the Bragg reflection are specified.

    Note that monochromators may have either 'parallel' or
    'antiparallel' orientation. It is assumed that the
    geometry is parallel unless specified otherwise.
    In a parallel geometry, the position of the monochromator
    allows the incident beam and the final post-specimen
    and post-monochromator beam to be as close to parallel
    as possible. In a parallel geometry, the diffracting
    planes in the specimen and monochromator will be parallel
    when 2θ~monochromator~ is equal to 2θ~specimen~.

    An arbitrary code is assigned to each peak. Used to link with
    _pd_refln.peak_id so that multiple hkl and/or phase
    identifications can be assigned to a single peak.
    Each peak will have a unique code. In cases
    where two peaks are severely overlapped, it may be
    desirable to list them as a single peak.

    A peak ID must be included for every peak.

    March distribution parameter describing the degree of
    preferred-orientation in a given phase and diffractogram.
    In general, a value of 1 describes an unoriented phase.
    r in the range (1, ∞) describes orientation of disk-like
    particles, and r in the range (0,1) describes orientation
    of needle-like particles.

    The direction of the correction must also be given using
    _pd_pref_orient_March_Dollase.index_h, _k, and _l. If
    more than one orientation direction is used, the fractional
    contribution of each direction must be specified with
    _pd_pref_orient_March_Dollase.fract.

    Omitting _pd_pref_orient.* implies that no preferred-
    orientation correction has been used.

    The order (i) and term (j) of the spherical harmonic
    preferred-orientation correction. Spherical
    harmonics are functions that obey the point-symmetry
    operations of the phase, and can be used to model
    deviations in peak intensity due to preferred-orientation
    or texture.

    In the application of spherical harmonics corrections,
    valid orders are positive, even integers, and possible
    terms are in the range -i:i. Valid terms are restricted
    by space-group symmetry. The parity of the term is given
    by its sign; odd parity is negative, even is positive.

    Omitting _pd_pref_orient.* implies that no preferred-
    orientation correction has been used.

    The 'specimen' is the artefact placed into the beam. The specimen is made
    from the 'sample'. Information about the sample is specified in PD_PREP.

    'Specimen', 'sample', and 'material' have specific meanings, and sometimes
    cannot be specifically deliniated. The 'specimen' is the artefact placed
    into the beam from which the diffraction measurement is taken, and is
    described in PD_SPEC. The specimen is made from the 'sample', which can have
    information specified in PD_PREP. The sample is drawn from a 'material',
    which may exist in an actual or idealised sense, which can have information
    specified in PD_CHAR. For example: the material might be BaTiO3, the
    sample might be a specific batch from a specific manufacturer, and the
    specimen is the material taken from the bottle and placed in the instrument.

    Description of the background treatment mechanism used to
    fit the data set.

    For refinements where the background is computed as a
    function that is fitted to minimize the difference between
    the observed and calculated patterns, it is
    recommended that in addition to a description of the
    function (e.g. Chebychev polynomial), the actual equation(s)
    used are included in TeX, or a programming language such
    as Fortran or C. Include also the values used for the
    coefficients used in the background function with their
    s.u.'s. The background values for each data point
    computed from the function should be specified in
    _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_calc.

    If background correction is performed using extrapolation
    from a set of points at fixed locations, these points
    should be defined using _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_fix, and
    _pd_proc_ls.background_function should indicate the
    extrapolation method (linear extrapolation, spline etc.).
    _pd_proc_ls.background_function should also indicate how the
    points were determined (automatically, by visual estimation
    etc.) and whether the values were refined to improve the
    agreement. The extrapolated background intensity value for
    each data point should be specified in
    _pd_proc.intensity_bkg_calc.

    _pd_proc_ls.prof_R_factor, often called R~p~, is an

    _pd_proc_ls.prof_wR_expected, sometimes called the
      theoretical R~wp~ or R~exp~, is a weighted fitness metric for
      the statistical precision of the data set. For an idealised fit,
      where all deviations between the observed intensities and
      those computed from the model are due to statistical
      fluctuations, the observed R~wp~ should match the expected
      R factor. In reality, R~wp~ will always be higher than
      R~exp~.
        R~exp~ = SQRT { (n - p)  / sum~i~ ( w(i) [I~obs~(i)]^2^ ) }

    This category identifies the external diffractogram used for
    quantitative phase analysis.

    Quantification by external standard is typically carried out
    using the O'Connor and Raven algorithm in conjunction with whole-pattern
    Rietveld modelling, and relies on the determination of
    the diffractometer constant, K. The use of an external standard
    allows for the calculation of absolute mass fractions, giving
    an indication of amorphous content. This method requires the
    mass attenuation coefficient of the specimen to be measured or
    calculated. For a review on quantitative phase analysis, see
    Chapter 3.9 of International Tables, Vol. H, and references therein.

    The value of the diffractometer constant, K, applied to the
    quantification of the phases present in the given diffractogram.

    The external standard method is described by O'Connor and Raven.
    In this method, the absolute mass percent of a phase is given as

    W~k~ = 100 * s~k~ * M~k~ * V~k~ * μ^*^ / K

    where W~k~, s~k~, M~k~, & V~k~ are the absolute mass percent, Rietveld
    scale factor, unit cell mass, and unit cell volume of phase k.
    μ^*^ is the mass attenuation coefficient of the specimen, and K is
    the normalising diffractometer constant.

    An intensity or scale factor value associated with the given phase and
    diffractogram, which, when divided by the appropriate calibration value
    defined in _pd_qpa_calib_factor.*, allows quantitative phase analysis to be
    undertaken.

    This value is not, in general, transferable between different program types
    and versions, as each software package may incorporate different constants
    or normalisations into their calculations. However, if all values for a
    given diffractogram are self-consistent, then quantification can be
    undertaken.

    the equivalent enumeration in _pd_qpa_overall.method.

    This category identifies the internal standard used for
    quantitative phase analysis.

    Quantification by internal standard can be carried out by a variety
    of different methods, including the Reference Intensity Ratio or the
    Hill & Howard algorithm in conjunction with whole-pattern Rietveld
    modelling.

    In general, the use of an internal standard converts relative phase
    mass percentages into absolute mass percentage, allowing determination
    of the 'unknown' (or 'amorphous', 'noncrystalline', or 'unanalysed')
    fraction of the specimen.

    This can be done as

        W~p~^abs.^ = W~p~^rel.^ * (W~s~^known^ / W~s~^rel.^)

    where p and s represent the analyte phase and standard phase, respectively,
    W is the weight fraction, 'abs.' is absolute, 'rel.' is relative, and
    'known' is the known addition. Here, W~s~^rel.^ is the relative amount of
    standard as calculated by the quantification algorithm.

    For a review on quantitative phase analysis, see Chapter 3.9 of
    International Tables, Vol. H, and references therein.

    Per cent crystallinity of the internal standard.

    Materials are rarely 100% crystalline as the crystal structure at the
    material's surface is able to relax, and/or contain reaction products. This
    thin, disordered surface layer can account for several mass percent of the
    standard, and, as such, can affect any resultant quantification based on the
    standard.

    Knowledge of the internal standard crystallinity allows for the known mass
    addition to be corrected to a crystalline addition, which is the addition
    being analysed in a diffraction experiment.

             W~p~ = [I~p~ / C~p~] * μ^*^~m~

         where I~p~ is the intensity of the analyte peak, μ^*^~m~ is the mass
         absorption coefficient of the entire specimen, and C~p~ is a previously
         determined calibration constant which depends on the data collection
         conditions and the nature of the phase being calibrated. Intensities
         from unknown specimens must be collected under the same conditions as
         the calibration was determined, or normalised to match.

         Quantitative phase analysis was undertaken following the Direct
         Derivation Method [1-6].

         The relative weight fraction of phase p, W~p~, is given by

             W~p~ = (I~p~ / C~p~) / Sum(I~k~ / C~k~, k=1:P)

         where I~p~ is the integrated, Lp-normalised intensity of the analyte
         phase over the entire diffractogram. The sum is taken over all phases
         present. C~p~ is given by

             C~p~ = (1/M~p~) * Sum(n~i,p~^2^, i=1:N~p~)

         where M~p~ is the chemical formula weight of phase p, n~i,p~ is the
         number of electrons belonging to the i^th^ atom of phase p, and N~p~ is
         the number of atoms in the formula unit of phase p.

         The values utilised for I~p~ and C~p~ can be recorded using
         _pd_qpa_intensity_factor.value and _pd_qpa_calib_factor.DDM,
         respectively.

         If an internal standard, s, is present with a known addition, the
         relative weight fractions can be converted to absolute weight fractions
         by

            W~p~^absolute^ = W~p~^relative^ * (W~s~^known^ / W~s~^relative^)

         Any difference between the sum of the individual phase weight
         percentages and 100 wt% can be attributed to unanalysed or amorphous
         phases.

         Quantitative phase analysis was undertaken following the external

         The absolute weight fraction of phase p, W~p~, is given by

             W~p~ = [I~p~ / C~p~] * μ^*^~m~

         where I~p~ = S~p~/K, where S~p~ is the Rietveld scale factor of the
         analyte phase and K is a previously determined diffractometer constant.
         μ^*^~m~ is the mass absorption coefficient of the entire specimen.
         C~p~ is given as

             C~p~ = 1 /(Z * M * V)~p~

         where Z is the number of formula units per unit cell, M is the chemical
         formula weight, and V is the volume of the unit cell, all of phase p.

         _pd_char.mass_atten_coef_mu_calc or _pd_char.mass_atten_coef_mu_meas
         must be given for the specimen in each diffractogram.

         The values utilised for I~p~ and C~p~ can be recorded using

         PONKCS
;
         Quantitative phase analysis was undertaken following the Partial Or No
         Known Crystal Structure methodology [1].

         The relative weight fraction of phase p, W~p~, is given by

             W~p~ = (S~p~ / C~p~) / Sum(S~k~ / C~k~, k=1:P)

         where S~p~ is the Rietveld scale factor of the analyte phase. The sum
         is taken over all phases present, and

             C~p~ = (W~s~/W~p~) * (S~p~/S~s~) * (1/(ZMV)~s~)

         where W is the weight fraction, S is the Rietveld scale factor, Z is
         the number of formula units per unit cell, M is the chemical
         formula weight, and V is the volume of the unit cell. The subscript p
         denotes the analyte phase, and s denotes the standard phase.

         The intensities of the peaks assigned to the PONKCS phase, when taken
         in combination with C~p~, act as pseudo-F_squared values. Because of
         this, once a particular phase has been calibrated, it's value of C~p~
         is consistent with ZMV values and can be used in conjunction with the
         ZMV algorithm with normal, crystalline phases to quantify relative
         phase fractions in mixtures containing this phase.

         If any phase in an analysis of a diffractogram uses the PONKCS
         approach, the entire quantification is to be marked as 'PONKCS', and
         all phases should define _pd_qpa_calib_factor.ponkcs.

         The values utilised for I~p~ and C~p~ can be recorded using
         _pd_qpa_intensity_factor.value and _pd_qpa_calib_factor.PONKCS,
         respectively.

         If an internal standard, s, is present with a known addition, the
         relative weight fractions can be converted to absolute weight fractions
         by

            W~p~^absolute^ = W~p~^relative^ * (W~s~^known^ / W~s~^relative^)

         Any difference between the sum of the individual phase weight
         percentages and 100 wt% can be attributed to unanalysed or amorphous
         phases.

         RIR
;
         For an RIR value made with reference to corundum, see the state
         'I/Ic'.

         Quantitative phase analysis was undertaken following the Reference
         Intensity Ratio methodology [1].

         The method of determining the RIR value, and the particular standard
         against which it was calculated should be given in the
         _pd_qpa_calib_factor.special_details for each phase.

         The relative weight fraction of phase p, W~p~, is given by

             W~p~ = [I~p~ / C~p~] / Sum[I~k~ / C~k~, k=1:P]

         where I~p~=I~p~^'^/I~p,rel~, where I~p~^'^ is the intensity of the
         analyte peak of phase p and I~P,rel~ is the intensity ratio between the
         analyte peak and the most intense peak for phase p. The sum is taken
         over all phases present in the specimen. C~p~ is the reference
         intensity ratio for phase p, must be pre-calculated with a known,
         crystalline internal standard, as

             C~p~ = (W~s~/W~p~) * (I~p~^'^/I~s~^'^) * (I~s,rel~/(I~p,rel~)

         The values utilised for I~p~ and C~p~ can be recorded using
         _pd_qpa_intensity_factor.value and _pd_qpa_calib_factor.RIR,
         respectively.

         If an internal standard, s, is present with a known addition, the
         relative weight fractions can be converted to absolute weight fractions
         by

            W~p~^absolute^ = W~p~^relative^ * (W~s~^known^ / W~s~^relative^)

         Any difference between the sum of the individual phase weight
         percentages and 100 wt% can be attributed to unanalysed or amorphous
         phases.

         ZMV
;
         Quantitative phase analysis was undertaken following the ZMV
         algorithm [1-2] in conjunction with Rietveld [3] refinements.

         The relative weight fraction of phase p, W~p~, is given by

             W~p~ = (S~p~ / C~p~) / Sum(S~k~ / C~k~, k=1:P)

         where S~p~ is the Rietveld scale factor of the analyte phase. The sum
         is taken over all phases present, and

             C~p~ = 1/(Z * M * V)~p~

         where Z is the number of formula units per unit cell, M is the chemical
         formula weight, and V is the volume of the unit cell, all of phase p.

         The values utilised for I~p~ and C~p~ can be recorded using
         _pd_qpa_intensity_factor.value and _pd_qpa_calib_factor.ZMV,
         respectively.

         If an internal standard, s, is present with a known addition, the
         relative weight fractions can be converted to absolute weight fractions
         by

            W~p~^absolute^ = W~p~^relative^ * (W~s~^known^ / W~s~^relative^)

         Any difference between the sum of the individual phase weight
         percentages and 100 wt% can be attributed to unanalysed or amorphous
         phases.

    This section contains information about the specimen used for measurement of
    the diffraction data set.

    'Specimen', 'sample', and 'material' have specific meanings, and sometimes
    cannot be specifically deliniated. The 'specimen' is the artefact placed
    into the beam from which the diffraction measurement is taken, and is
    described in PD_SPEC. The specimen is made from the 'sample', which can have
    information specified in PD_PREP. The sample is drawn from a 'material',
    which may exist in an actual or idealised sense, which can have information
    specified in PD_CHAR. For example: the material might be BaTiO3, the
    sample might be a specific batch from a specific manufacturer, and the
    specimen is the material taken from the bottle and placed in the instrument.

    The orientation of the ω (θ) and 2θ axis.
    Note that this axis is parallel to the specimen axial axis
    and perpendicular to the plane containing the incident and
    scattered beams.

    Thus for a horizontal orientation, scattering
    measurements are made in a plane perpendicular to the
    ground (the 2θ axis is parallel to the ground);
    for vertical orientation, scattering measurements are
    made in a plane parallel with the ground (the 2θ axis
    is perpendicular to the ground). 'Both' is appropriate for
    experiments where measurements are made in both planes,
    for example using two-dimensional detectors.
